WebPanoptoAPI
=============

This site contains source code written by Graham Robinson for the Panopto API.

You MUST edit web.config to update the endpoint from https://localhost to your
server address (unless you are using your Panopto server and https://localhost
is set up to work correctly).

Information and tutorials on using the Panopto API, including all code available
from this site are available on http://www.mediaguy.co.uk
